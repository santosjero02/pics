        I whisper your name night after night
        I love you too much
        There's only one feeling and I know it's right
        I know I belong
        When I sing this song
        There's love above love and it's ours
        'Cause I love you too much
        Heaven knows your name I've been praying
        To have you come here by my side
        Without you a part of me's missing
        Just to make you my home, I will fight
        I know I belong
        When I sing this song
        There's love above love and it's ours
        'Cause I love you too much
        I love you too much
        I love you too much
        Heaven's my witness and this is a fact
        You live in my soul
        Your heart is my goal
        There's love above love and it's mine 'cause I love you
        There's love above love and it's yours 'cause I love you
        There's love above love and it's ours
        If you love me as much
